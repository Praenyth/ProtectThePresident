# Protect The President!
## CURRENTLY UNPLAYABLE!! IT'S IN IT'S VERY EARLY STAGE!!

### A simple yet silly minigame!

The premise is simple:

- The Hunter(s)' goal is to hunt down and kill the President.
- The Bodyguard(s)' goal is to protect the President at all costs.
- The President(s)' goal is to stay alive
  - ENDLESS mode is when the President(s) have to stay alive for as long as possible.
  - TIMED mode is when the President(s) have to stay alive for a certain amount of time. If the President survives for however long, they win.

Both Hunter(s) and Bodyguard(s) will have infinite lives while the President only has one.

A grace period will also be added, where the hunters are frozen at spawn, giving the President(s) and their henchmen a head start!

When the game starts, Hunter(s) will get a compass that tracks the President(s)' current location and the President will also (optionally) recieve glowing (if the compass wasn't enough).
